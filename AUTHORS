Authors of The Solid POP3 Server:

Jerzy Balamut.  Everything as for now.

Arkadiusz Miskiewicz.  Automake support. First version of all ".am"
and configure.in files.

Tilman Blumenbach.  Slight Autotools modernization and support
for properly handling "damaged" messages without trailing newlines
in maildir component (they are now always fixed on-the-fly; original
message files are not modified).
